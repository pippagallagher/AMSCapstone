# Projects in Data Science: Twin Cities Public Transportation Funding and Ridership 
Author: Pippa Gallagher 

The following project aims to answer the following question: How does the funding of buses affect ridership on twin cities public transportation? Using data from Metro Transit I was able to detect if bus stops with bus shelters performed better than expected during the pandemic and where they were located.

All of the data needed to run the R Markdown is available in this repositopry. This data comes from Metro Transit. Download all of the files and change the location when reading in the data in the R Markdown. The packages needed are leaflet,tidyverse,sf and ggplot2.
